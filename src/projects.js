      "Know It All was a project created during the final group project phase of the Northcoders bootcamp. Our group was tasked with pitching three ideas for an app, spike our chosen technology for them, and also create MVPs. For this project, we decided to challenge ourself by learning and utilising new technologies not covered on the course, all in the mere 2-week timeframe we had to complete the project. Know It All is a web app that allows users to partake in a daily quiz comprising of five questions. Users are given a score based on their time taken and how many questions they answer correctly. Users also have access to stats such as their daily streak, and if they sign up, will be granted their own account where they can unlock achievements, and also join leaderboards which reset daily.",

      "The House of Games was a project created during my time with Northcoders, as a front-end means to connect with the REST api I created prior. Users are able to browse the website as a guest and view all of the latest reviews, but if they log in using one of the pre-existing accounts, they are able to access a multitude of additional features, such as the ability to post new reviews, comment and like existing reviews, and delete their own comments and reviews they've posted. Users are also able to sort and filter search results using a combination of different queries. The site is responsive and was designed and developed with a mobile-first approach.",
